"""The agent's own books: what it remembers, what it owes, what it wrote down.

Three things live here and they are deliberately separate from the receipts.

``State`` is the small JSON file that lets the process die and come back without
lying about what happened. It holds the cycle counter, the last refusal the
agent was told about, an escalation still waiting on people, and — the part that
matters most — the receipt id and nonce of an action that was *started*. The
nonce is written to disk before the proposal leaves the process, so a crash
between proposing and journalling can never turn into a second proposal: on the
way back up the agent looks that receipt up in its own store and journals what
actually happened, and if it cannot find it, it says so and moves on. It never
re-sends. A trading agent that retries on restart is a trading agent that
double-trades on a bad afternoon.

``Bill`` is the agent's cost of existing. It counts its own tokens from what the
API reported, prices them at the rate in the config, and once a week proposes to
pay the operator for them out of the treasury. This is the honest part of the
story: the agent is not free, it knows what it costs, and if it cannot cover
that cost it stops rather than quietly running on somebody else's money.

``Journal`` is the public diary — two lines a cycle in ``journal.md``, the same
facts as data in ``journal.jsonl``. It is not evidence and does not pretend to
be; the receipt is the evidence. This is the part a human reads over coffee.

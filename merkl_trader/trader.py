"""The loop. Read the market, ask the model, act at most once, write it down.

    python -m merkl_trader --config trader.toml

That is the whole program. It is a plain process — no scheduler, no queue, no
daemon — and it is meant to be run under whatever already restarts things on the
machine you have. What makes a restart safe is not the supervisor, it is
``ledger.State``: the nonce and receipt id of an action are on disk *before* the
proposal leaves this process, so coming back up is a matter of looking up what
happened rather than guessing, and nothing is ever re-proposed.

The order inside a cycle is deliberate:

1. finish anything that was in flight when the process last died;
2. resolve any escalation a human has now answered, before deciding anything new
   — an agent that made a fresh decision while a human was still thinking about
   its last one would be an agent whose escalations mean nothing;
3. read the market and the treasury;
4. if the compute bill is due, pay it — that is this cycle's one action;
5. otherwise ask the model, and act on at most one thing it says;
6. journal, sleep.

Every refusal becomes the next cycle's lesson, in the signer's own words. That
feedback loop is the only channel through which this agent ever learns what its
policy says.

Long, on purpose. A proposal that escalates has to survive a person reading it

into an expiry — the agent would propose, wait, be told the window closed, and
propose again forever. The exposure is small: the nonce makes a replay a
refusal, and a swap can only ever fill at the limit price the agent already
